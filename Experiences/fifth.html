            At the Cigna Group I worked in the Data & Analytics Department, developing programs to efficiently clean, sort, and move data between services like Databricks and Teradata. In this role, I gained experience in working with ETL processes and managing on-prim and cloud-based data. 
            <br><br>
            I also worked on developing a full-stack application as part of the intern summer-long hackathon, which gave me experience in back-end server and database management and creating/working with REST APIs.
