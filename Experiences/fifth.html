            At The Cigna Group, I worked in the Data and Analytics Department doing Software and Data Engineering work. Specifically, I worked on 2 main projects. <br><br>

            I worked on migrating data from on-prim databases to the cloud. I also reprogrammed Teradata stored procedures from Teradata SQL into SparkSQL or PySpark. This was part of a department-wide effort to optimize and refactor SQL code.<br><br>

            I also worked on a proof of concept to transfer data from AWS S3 Buckets to Delta tables on Databricks, as part of a data analysis pipeline to analyze customer call data.<br><br>

            I also worked on the back-end for an internal proof of concept that displayed drug prices from various vendors to understand by how much Cigna's pharmaceutical division should reduce drug prices. This was part of an intern challenge to develop health-based software.<br><br> 

            Specifically, I worked on designing and implementing the back-end express API and our MongoDB Database.
