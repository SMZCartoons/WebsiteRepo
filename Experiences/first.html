            As an AI Software Engineer Intern, I worked part-time from September 2024 - May 2024, and then as a summer intern May 2024 - August 2024, and part-time again from August 2024 - present. I work as part of the Applied Generative AI team, building internal AI-powered software and tools to be used throughout the enterprise, from business analysts to software engineers. 
            <br><br>
            My work revolved around assisting with the development of the backend of a data generation webapp and a text-to-SQL application. In this role, I gained experience in both backend and frontend development, cloud development/resource management, ML/AI work, and proof of concept work.

            <ul class="lists">
                <li>Developed Python LLM-powered SQL Analytics Algorithm to extract data on tables in PySpark and Teradata SQL files and ingests data into Neo4j knowledge graph databases using Cypher Querying Language and Kubernetes</li>
                
                <li>Intend to capture 2623 stored procedures, 10582 SQL statements, and 77378 join conditions, and will be used as metadata for enterprise-wide text-to-SQL algorithm to improve join condition generation ability</li>

            <ul class="lists">
                <li>Refactored existing Python text-to-SQL algorithm using Neomodel, an object-graph-model framework similar to an ORM, to provide schema enforcement on the Neo4j in knowledge graph, enabling CICD for the enterprise context database that is used for multiple internal GenAI applications</li>
                <li>Developed Python streamlit UI over data warehouse storing relational metadata in Neo4j and deployed to Amazon EKS which empowered engineer performance optimization efforts by eliminating the need for Cypher Query Language to access insights, saving the enterprise ~$2400 annually by providing read-only RBAC</li>
                <li>Developed DAG in AWS to perform stress tests to evaluate MWAA dev environmentâ€™s ability to connect with various services, such as Redis and Oracle, increasing connectivity ability by 77% and providing feedback to improve environment used by 20+ engineers to develop multiple enterprise-wide tools</li>
            </ul>
