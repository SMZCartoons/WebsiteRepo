            During the Spring Semester of my Junior Year, I worked for CeMSIM developing a video analysis pipeline which, when given a video of someone performing practice surgery, determines if the procedure would be successful or not, using Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques. <br><br>

            Development and tuning of the model is still ongoing, but the model would be used to provide less biased and more accurate scoring of surgical assessments, while possibly providing insight on how it could be improved.
