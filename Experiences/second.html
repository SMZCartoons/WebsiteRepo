            During the Spring Semester of my Junior Year, I worked for CeMSIM developing a video analysis pipeline which, when given a video of someone performing practice surgery, determines if the procedure would be successful or not, using Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques. This project contained two primary components: a data cleaning pipeline and the actual neural network.
            <br><br>
           
            In this position, I had weekly meetings with a post-doc researcher I worked with to build this project, and presented the project to the entire lab midway and at the end of the semester. Additionally, I wrote a final report detailing the project and the findings.
