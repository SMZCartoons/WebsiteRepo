            At the CogWorks Lab, I worked on two primary projects. <br><br>

            The first was organizing metadata generated from volunteers playing Tetris. This was used as a part of the Lab's effort to use logs of Tetris Players to gain insights on human's cognitive processes, specifically on how they react to situations of increasing difficulty and pressure.  <br><br>

            I also helped design and test levels of an experimental game used to track the correlation between individual cognition and group behavior. The game was a cooking simulator game where groups of 4 players attempt to fulfill as many orders as possible.  <br><br>

            I collaborated with labmates to design various levels to challenge users in various ways, and led trials where volunteers played the game while we tracked where they were looking on the screen.
