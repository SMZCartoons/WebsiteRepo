            During my Freshmen Year Summer, I worked as a Researcher for CISL, which focuses on researching the intersection of Cognitive Science and Computer Science to augment group intelligence. Specifically, I worked on developing a Human Computer Communication Interface to allow users to have spoken discussions with trained chatbots, which will return audio responses.<br><br>

            My main task was to update and re-develop this system using Google Dialogue Systems (Google Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, and DialogueFlow). This program would be used in multiple projects in the Lab, including a game on a 360-deg environment where users interact with Non-Playable Characters, which speak in Mandarin, to learn the language.
