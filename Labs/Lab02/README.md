# ITWS1100 - Lab 2

## Observations
I primarily based this resume off of my existing resume, which is why it doesn't fully resemble the template. Nevertheless, I focused on including the main skeleton of it as instructed

1. The first block is the mission statement and my version of the profile section
2. The education section includes details on my degree and relevant courseworl
3. The Work experience section is similar to the Experience section and includes information on my relevant experience 
4. Honors is an extra section that details any awards I have recieved
5. Skills/interests is similar to the profile block in the example resume, providing more info on my capabilities and personality

## Comments
While this resume is up to date, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to add two sections, though I hope to add them in the future
1. Projects. I would like to add a section under "Work Experiences" that shows the different projects I have worked on thusfar
2. Leadership. This would hold any leading roles I have or had in extracurriculars
