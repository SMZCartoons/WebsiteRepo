Comments About Lab and Defense of Styles:

In this lab, since I love movies and try to keep up to date with various movie news, I decided to make my feed focus arond movie-based articles. I used the New York Times since they keep their RSS feeds public and because they typically have more ethos when it comes to writing articles in general.

With RSS it primarily copy and paste as the documents could be one-to-one. With Atom, it was a little more tricky since I had to take my RSS file and convert it into atom

I also made sure to keep the landing page for the lab to be a similar style as the other pages on the website. This means a similar background format, similar links to the feed pages.
