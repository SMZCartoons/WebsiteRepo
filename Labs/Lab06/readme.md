Answer to 4b
--------------
When I click the new Li's, the bullet points turn red. This is because the way I implemented the changing to red was such that it would work for any li that was on the html page, thus meaning that any new li's would fall under the criteria to turn red.

-----------------------------

The main idea behind the lab is to implement different JQuery features in order to demonstrate knowledge of Jquery and its multiple uses. 

There are no bugs in the code, as I followed the instructions outlined in the js file. The sections work well, and in part 4, newly listed items in the page's list toggle between being red and not when being clicked on

Additionally, I formatted the Jquery code to work with minimal statements so that the code is better organized and more condensed
