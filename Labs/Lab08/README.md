In this lab, I followed the instructions and queries the JSON file with data on the images and different hyperlinks I had for my landing page for projects. I created a JSON File that was formatted such that it started with the hyperlinks to existing labs, and images that are placeholders to upcoming labs, and then looped through each of them separately and wrapped them in HTML tags for a better output.

For my Jquery transitions, I wanted to make it so that the webpage would look as if the text was being loaded slowly right in front of the user. So, I started by having the text either fade in or slide as if they were being unveiled.

One bug I would like to fix if given more time would be that during the Jquery transition, the scrollbar doesnt appear until the webpage gets big enough, causing the elements in the page to shift to the left a bit.
