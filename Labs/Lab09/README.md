In this lab, I queried the RSS and ATOM data files from lab 4 and placed them into separate html files. Specifically, I organized my code so I had documents used for specific datatypes, so the process was very clear from a high-level viewpoint. Thus, for each input data file, I had a js and html file, where the js used the AJAX API to build the html code to visualize the data and the html file was where the user can view the data.

Additionally, I created a simple landing page similar to the landing page of Lab 4 just so the user can have access to both news feeds.
