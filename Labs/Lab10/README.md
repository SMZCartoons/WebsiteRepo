In this lab I didn't implement anything extra, but just stuck to the guidelines given. Specifically, I made sure to create the actors table and the program to display the movies table. I also made sure to create the relationship table between movies and tv shows, which I paired by relating movies in row i to actors in row i of their respective tables.
