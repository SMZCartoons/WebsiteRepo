            This project was part of the intern challenge in my 2023 Summer Internship with The Cigna Group. My intern team developed a website that displayed Drug pricing data from various vendors. This data would be used by business analysts to understand by how much Cigna drug prices could be dropped to pass savings to consumers.<br><br>

I worked on the back-end team and worked on designing the back-end server to allow front-end to communicate with our MongoDB Database, which housed the pricing data for various drugs. I also worked on programming the various API endpoints (in this case various GET requests) and presented details of our back-end in the company-wide final presentation.
