        <p id="blurb3">
            During my 2024 summer internship at The Cigna Group, I worked alongside 9 other interns to develop MyCity, an internal networking application, as part of the Cigna intern hackathon. I served as the teamâ€™s back-end lead and database administrator. 
            <br><br>
            The problem we were given to solve was to find a way to gamify employee career development, to allow them to consistently develop new skills and relationships with other employees. Our application focused on gamifying the networking experience by providing users with a city that they can grow as they connect with more employees and gain more skills. By growing their city, they gain more points that they can cash in for prizes.
            <br><br>
            As back-end lead, I spearheaded the design and management of our entire back-end, which exists on AWS. Specifically, I led a sub-team of 5 interns in the development of our DynamoDB database and a REST API to access its data using typescript and AWS Lambda, all totalling to less than $1000 estimated back-end related yearly costs.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I led the integration of back-end API endpoints with 10+ front-end web pages, using Next.js and Typescript, enabling functionality throughout the website and enhancing user experience and interaction. 
            <br><br>
            Our application is fully deployed on AWS using the Cloud Development Kit, and is in the process of being patent-approved. Additionally, it is expected to be used among various teams in the company.
