            The project is a video analysis pipeline, that when given a video of someone performing practice surgery, determines if it is successful or not. <br><br>

            I collaborated with a post-doc researcher to develop this ML pipeline. Specifically, I worked on developing the portion of the pipeline that cleans the input video by using OpenCV and NumPy to create a vignetting filter on each frame, with the center of the effect being where the surgeon is looking. This eliminates extraneous details in the video. <br><br> 

            I also worked on the final classifier that, when given a feature vector extracted from the input video, returns a whether the procedure was successful or not. The model used for this was a 1D CNN made with the PyTorch Neural Network Package, and resulted in around 88% Accuracy.
