            The project is a video analysis pipeline, that when given a video of someone performing practice surgery, determines if it is successful or not. <br><br>

            I collaborated with a post-doc researcher to develop this ML pipeline. It is split into two parts: data cleaning and the neural network
            
            The data cleaning program was built using OpenCV and Numpy so that when given a single video containing a series of trials, it splits the video into multiple clips, with each clip holding a single trial. After this, it applies a vignette filter on each frame, with the center of the filter being where the surgeon is looking. The resulting video is then condensed to a feature matrix, where each row of data represents data on each frame.
            <br><br>
            The neural network was a 1D convolutional neural network, created using PyTorch. The model has 2 hidden layers, which was determined by testing the performance of the model based on the number of layers. The result outputted by the model is a 2-element vector, where the first element represents the weight that the video wasnâ€™t successful, and the second is the weight that the video was successful. The element with the greatest weight is the predicted outcome.
            <br><br>
            The results were an 88% test accuracy rate and an average test loss of 0.41. The model and pipeline are expected to be used in a research project and a potential paper as part of joint study between RPI and University of Buffalo.
