            CloudFrontiers is a Proof of Concept website that was developed as the final project for my Spring 2024 Web Science Class. 
            <br><br>
            It provides ready-to-go Market Analysis for various cloud-based products, including details such as the pricing and what service it is included in.
            <br><br>
            The site allows users to look up various type of products (NoSQL Databases, Cloud Containers, etc) and view various offering from various vendors, and allow them to view any 2 offerings compared side-by-side. The site then offers users to export the generated data as either a JSON or CSV file. 
            <br><br>
            I worked as project lead and spearheaded the main project planning, UI Designing/Page functionality, and programming portions of the project, while collaborating with other groupmates to build the site. I led programming on the front-end of the application as well as itâ€™s functionality, and deployed the application on an instance in Azure.
