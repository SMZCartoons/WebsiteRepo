In this lab, I primarily followed the instructions to the T, so that the primary features of this lab is that I fixed the "crimes" in the code, forced the user to need to enter something into each input to submit, added the nickname button to print out the first name, last name, and nickname when prompted, and made it so the please enter your comments would disappear and reappear depending on if the user clicked on the comments box or not.

I also added an extra feature where once a user tries to submit an incomplete form, it focuses on the first incomplete input area.
