            About Me
        </h1>
        <p id="blurb">
            I am a Junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and am Majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Information Technology and Web Science. <br><br>
            
            I am very interested in Back-End and Front-End Software and Application Development, Cloud Development, and Computer Vision/Graphics.<br><br>
            
            
            I am currently interning as a Software Engineer at The Cigna Group, where I am working on integrating AI-powered features into the back-end of various applications
            using python, REST APIs, and AWS.<br><br>

            I am also working for the Center of Modeling, Simulation, and Imaging in Medicine as an Undergraduate Researcher, where I am using Pytorch and Teras to analyze videos of trial medical procedures and 
            determine if they are being performed correctly.<br><br>
